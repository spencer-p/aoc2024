# mistakes

- I had to write nums
- I didn't use nums for one part and mixed chars and nums
- i got bit by dictionaries not having good default/not found semantics
- i forgot to force integer division
- I range'd over the wrong numbers (values instead of index)
- I wrote a bad if `i < j continue` line, when I meant the opposite That
  wouldn't have been needed if I had gotten the range right the first time

- i misread the problem for part 2 only asking for fixed lines

# possible improvements

- I wrote graph init, that could be a helper?
- I am not used to ctrl-k to run yet
- I could auto-copy the printed result
- downloading the test input ?

# wins

- I got sub 30m
- my input downloader worked well
