nice bait and switch, i feel i should have seen part 2 coming but I have been
excited for a dynamic programming problem.

i did the derivation for the button presses by hand, and I had to do it twice
to get it right.

weirdly they are equivalent, but the second was a simpler form. I suspect there
were floating point errors in my first attempt.

first sub-2k for both parts, with a 43m time. not bad!
