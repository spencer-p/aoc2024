nice chill day. easy to see improvements I could make

- my template has some bugs I need to reconcile with previous edits
- it would be great to have bfs, dfs, and dijkstra in my back pocket instead of
  writing them out again every time.
- i had to look up binary search to get my bisect algorithm right, would be good
  to have that one in the back pocket as well.
